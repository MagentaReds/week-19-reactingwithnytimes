# week-19-reactingwithnytimes

I used the file we had from the original NyTimes exercise in creating this react-tified version of it.  It is included in the repo as nytimessearch_scottstots.html for reference.

I kept most of the same css style, and followed the instructions fairly closely.

#### Notes on React-Router
I went ahead and used v4 of React-Router-Dom instead of the v2 used for the inclass examples.  It works well, but it took me a little longer to figure out how to use the new syntax of it.
